## Problem Statement
[Mobile App for Teens: Rebuild a prototype with Security and Usability](https://ohack.dev/project/e8y7sIQC7j2lT1YdGMmf)

Safespace seeks to provide a haven for teens who may find themselves trapped in an abusive relationship. The app contains both a with a wide range of resources that can assist with seeking help as well as an assortment of information that can help understand and identify abuse.

Our team's goal is to provide Safespace with a prototype that utilizies easy to use software implementations so that their app has the ability to scale and be maintained for the long term.

## Team Members
[Tan Xuan You](https://github.com/txythecegkid): Front End
[Carlos Franco](https://github.com/carlosfrancose): Back End

## What's our solution?
Our Safespace 2.0 is a simple React Native application that utilizes Firebase for both user authentication and Firestore cloud storage.

The app currently has UI for the following functions:
- Login users
- Disguise as a tic tac toe game
- Contact emergency contacts or 911
- Contact professional help
- Document abuse cases
- Implement a safety plan

## What challenges did we face?
Our team had fewer members than we expected, and so we had to adapt to the situation and boil down the app to its essentials. This proved quite difficult whilst working with new technologies, but ultimately served as a valuable learning experience.

## How will we keep this project going?
Complete Firebase implementation would be the first step in our post hackathon solution. Data that would be stored on the cloud must be encrypted before entering, since it contains sensitive idnetifiable information.
